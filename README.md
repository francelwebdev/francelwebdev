### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Francel AMAMOO. I am a Ruby On Rails back-end developer.
Ruby is the language that makes me more productive and is my primary backend programming language. I write very often Ruby and JavaScript code. I also have little front-end skills in JavaScript and Vuejs and little skills in Nodejs.
I am currently more learnning JavaScript, TypeScript and Nodejs and i'm looking for new opportunities.
