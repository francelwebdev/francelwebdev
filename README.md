### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Francel AMAMOO. I am a Ruby On Rails back-end developer.
Ruby is the language that makes me more productive. I write very often and mostly Ruby code. I also have little skills in Python + Django and Elixir + Phoenix and Nodejs based framework and front-end skills in JavaScript and Vuejs.
I am currently looking for new opportunities.
